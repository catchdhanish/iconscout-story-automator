**System Prompt**: Core system prompt with low colorfulness emphasis

**User Prompt**:
```
Create an abstract diagonal gradient background flowing from deep purple (#764BA2)
at the top-left to bright cyan (#4ECDC4) at the bottom-right. Add 2-3 small
geometric circles in navy blue at the top-right and bottom-left corners with
15% opacity. Keep the center area smooth and clean for overlaying a technology
icon. 1080x1920px, modern and professional aesthetic.
```

**Result**: Clean, professional background with perfect color harmony. Icon stood out excellently against gradient. No refinement needed.

**Key Success Factors**:

**Colorfulness**: Medium

**System Prompt**: Core system prompt with medium colorfulness

**User Prompt**:
```
Design a minimalist background with a subtle grid pattern using cool blue
tones (#667EEA, #5B86E5). Place small triangular shapes (10-15% size) at the
four corners, arranged in a clean pattern. Use a soft vertical gradient from
darker blue at the top to lighter blue at the bottom. Keep the center 70%
simple with just the gradient. 1080x1920px, tech-forward aesthetic.
```

**Result**: Professional, structured background. Complemented warm icon perfectly. Minor refinement: reduced triangle sizes by 20%.

**Key Success Factors**:
- Cool colors complemented warm asset
- Grid pattern suggested structure without overwhelming
- Specific corner placement kept center clean
- Vertical gradient created subtle depth

### Prompt 3: Radial Focus Tech ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Asset**: White icon on transparent background (AI/ML theme)
**Colors**: White/transparent
**Colorfulness**: Low

**System Prompt**: High contrast system prompt (for monochromatic assets)

**User Prompt**:
```
Generate a radial gradient background transitioning from vibrant magenta (#F093FB)
at the center to deep purple (#764BA2) at the edges. Add 3 soft circular rings
at different radii (25%, 50%, 75% from center) with 5% opacity in white. Create
a natural focal point for the icon overlay without being too bright in the
center. 1080x1920px, modern and dynamic.
```

**Result**: Beautiful radial composition with perfect center focus. White icon highly visible. No refinement needed.

**Key Success Factors**:
- Radial gradient naturally directed attention to center
- Soft rings added depth without distraction
- Vibrant colors energized white icon
- Specific opacity percentages controlled subtlety

## Category: Design/Creative Assets

### Prompt 4: Organic Flow Creative ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Asset**: Colorful illustration (character design)
**Colors**: Multi-color (red, blue, yellow, green)
**Colorfulness**: High

**System Prompt**: Colorful asset system prompt

**User Prompt**:
```
Create a subtle background with 2 large organic blob shapes in muted pastel
tones: soft pink (#FFB3BA) and light blue (#BAE1FF). Position one blob in the
top-right extending to mid-canvas, and one in bottom-left. Use a gentle
gradient blend between them through the center. Keep saturation low (30-40%)
to let the colorful asset shine. 1080x1920px, clean and contemporary.
```

**Result**: Perfect complement to colorful asset. Subtle background didn't compete. Minor refinement: increased blob size by 10% for better balance.

**Key Success Factors**:
- Muted, low-saturation colors (crucial for colorful assets)
- Organic shapes matched illustration style
- Specific positioning instructions
- Emphasized subtlety

### Prompt 5: Split Tone Creative ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Asset**: Purple/pink gradient icon (music/audio)
**Colors**: Purple, pink
**Colorfulness**: Medium

**System Prompt**: Core system prompt with medium colorfulness

**User Prompt**:
```
Design a dual-tone split background divided diagonally from top-right to
bottom-left. Use warm orange (#FF9068) on the top-right side and cool teal
(#44A08D) on the bottom-left side. Create a soft, wide gradient transition
zone (200px) between the two colors at the diagonal split. Add subtle noise
texture (8% opacity) throughout. 1080x1920px, vibrant and balanced.
```

**Result**: Bold, statement background that perfectly complemented gradient asset. Excellent color harmony. No refinement needed.

**Key Success Factors**:
- Complementary split (warm/cool) created visual interest
- Wide transition zone prevented harsh line
- Noise texture added sophistication
- Specific measurements for transition zone

### Prompt 6: Gradient Mesh Creative ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Asset**: Yellow illustration (sun/energy theme)
**Colors**: Warm yellows, oranges
**Colorfulness**: Medium-High

**System Prompt**: Colorful asset system prompt with playful tone

**User Prompt**:
```
Generate a vibrant gradient mesh background with colors flowing organically
across the canvas. Use cool complementary colors: deep blue (#4A00E0), cyan
(#36D1DC), and purple (#764BA2). Create non-linear color transitions that
feel dynamic but not chaotic. Keep the center area medium-toned (50% brightness)
for good contrast. 1080x1920px, energetic and modern.
```

**Result**: Dynamic, engaging background with excellent color contrast. Minor refinement: reduced purple saturation by 15% for better balance.

**Key Success Factors**:
- Complementary colors (cool vs warm asset)
- "Organic" flow keyword produced natural transitions
- Specified center brightness for visibility
- "Dynamic but not chaotic" set appropriate energy level

Design a minimalist background with a subtle diagonal line pattern (45-degree
angle, 2px width, 200px spacing) in light gray (#E8E8E8) over a soft gradient
from light blue (#E3F2FD) to white. Pattern should be barely visible (5%
opacity). Keep the overall feel clean, spacious, and professional. 1080x1920px,
corporate aesthetic.
```

**Result**: Ultra-professional background with sophisticated pattern. Minor refinement: increased pattern opacity to 8% for slightly more visibility.

**Key Success Factors**:

**User Prompt**:
```
Generate a clean background with 1 large organic blob shape in very soft
yellow (#FFF9C4) positioned in the top-left, extending to about 40% of the
canvas. Use a plain white background for the rest. Add a subtle drop shadow
from the blob (10% opacity, 50px blur). Keep it simple and let the colorful
asset be the star. 1080x1920px, friendly and approachable.
```

**Result**: Simple, effective background that showcased vibrant asset perfectly. Minor refinement: changed white to very light cream for warmth.

## Category: Pattern Experiments

### Prompt 11: Layered Circles ⭐⭐⭐

**Asset**: Orange icon (technology)
**Colors**: Orange tones
**Colorfulness**: Low-Medium

**System Prompt**: Core system prompt

**User Prompt**:
```
Design a background with 5 concentric circles centered at coordinates
(540, 1200) - slightly below center. Circles in complementary blue tones:
#667EEA, #5B86E5, #4A7BC8, #3A6BAC, #2C5AA0. Each circle 150px larger
radius than the previous. Fill with radial gradient (darker at edges).
1080x1920px, structured and modern.
```

**Result**: Interesting composition but circles too dominant. Refinement needed: reduced opacity to 40% and increased circle spacing.

**Key Success Factors** (after refinement):
- Specific coordinate placement
- Complementary color strategy
- Structured, geometric approach

**Lessons Learned**:
- Be more conservative with opacity initially
- Concentric circles can overwhelm - test with lower opacity

### Prompt 12: Diagonal Stripes ⭐⭐

**Asset**: Purple icon (design/creative)
**Colors**: Purple
**Colorfulness**: Low

**System Prompt**: Core system prompt

**User Prompt**:
```
Create a background with diagonal stripes (45-degree angle, 100px width,
alternating between #F093FB and #764BA2). Add slight blur between stripes
(10px) for smooth transitions. 1080x1920px, vibrant and dynamic.
```

**Result**: Too busy, stripes competed with asset. Major refinement needed: removed stripes, switched to simple two-color gradient.

**Lessons Learned**:
- Stripe patterns rarely work for Instagram Stories
- Too much structure distracts from asset
- Simpler is usually better
