# IconScout Brand Guidelines for Instagram Stories

Complete visual identity guide for generating Instagram Story backgrounds that align with IconScout's brand aesthetic.

## Brand Identity

### Core Values
- **Modern**: Contemporary design language, clean lines, intentional composition
- **Professional**: Polished execution, attention to detail, sophisticated aesthetics
- **Vibrant**: Bold use of color, energetic compositions, visual impact
- **Approachable**: Friendly, not intimidating; confident without being aggressive
- **Creative**: Innovative visual solutions, unexpected combinations, artistic expression

### Brand Personality

IconScout sits at the intersection of **professional** and **playful**:
- Professional enough for enterprise clients
- Creative enough for designers and makers
- Vibrant enough to stand out
- Clean enough to showcase assets

## Visual Style Principles

### 1. Modern Minimalism

**Definition**: Clean, uncluttered designs that prioritize essential elements

**Implementation**:
- Use negative space intentionally
- Limit elements to 3-5 key shapes per composition
- Choose simplicity over complexity when in doubt
- Geometric shapes should be precise and intentional
- Remove anything that doesn't serve a purpose

**Examples**:
- ✅ Broad diagonal gradient with 2 corner accents
- ✅ Single radial gradient with subtle texture
- ❌ 20 small shapes scattered across canvas
- ❌ Multiple competing pattern systems

### 2. Vibrant Color Palette

**Definition**: Bold, confident use of color that creates visual energy

**Primary Color Families**:
- **Purples/Blues**: `#667EEA`, `#764BA2`, `#4A00E0`
- **Teals/Cyans**: `#4ECDC4`, `#44A08D`, `#36D1DC`
- **Pinks/Magentas**: `#F093FB`, `#F5576C`, `#E94057`
- **Oranges/Yellows**: `#FFE66D`, `#FF6B6B`, `#FA8072`

**Secondary Accent Colors**:
- **Mint Green**: `#95E1D3`, `#5BE9B9`
- **Coral**: `#FD746C`, `#FF9068`
- **Lavender**: `#C471ED`, `#A594F9`

**Usage Guidelines**:
- Use 2-3 colors per background (rarely more)
- Ensure sufficient saturation (40-80% range)
- Avoid muddy colors (low saturation browns/grays)
- Create intentional color relationships (complementary, analogous, triadic)

### 3. Abstract Over Literal

**Definition**: Use shapes, gradients, and patterns rather than representational imagery

**Do**:
- Abstract organic shapes (blobs, flowing forms)
- Geometric patterns (triangles, circles, lines)
- Gradient transitions and color flows
- Textural elements (noise, grain, subtle patterns)

**Don't**:
- Realistic objects (trees, buildings, products)
- Literal icons or illustrations
- Photographs or photo-composite backgrounds
- Text or typography (except when explicitly requested)

### 4. Gradient Mastery

**Definition**: Smooth color transitions that create depth and movement

**Gradient Types**:

**Linear Gradients**:
- Horizontal: Left-to-right color transition
- Vertical: Top-to-bottom color transition
- Diagonal: Corner-to-corner flow (most dynamic)
- Usage: 40% of backgrounds

**Radial Gradients**:
- Center focus: Lighter/darker in center
- Edge focus: Darker/lighter at edges
- Usage: 25% of backgrounds

**Multi-Stop Gradients**:
- 3+ color transitions
- Create color journeys across canvas
- Usage: 20% of backgrounds

**Mesh/Complex Gradients**:
- Non-linear color flows
- Organic color blending
- Usage: 15% of backgrounds

**Best Practices**:
- Minimum 2 colors, maximum 4 colors per gradient
- Ensure smooth transitions (no harsh color breaks)
- Consider color theory (warm to cool transitions work well)
- Test readability with various asset colors

### 5. Intentional Composition

**Definition**: Every element placed with purpose, considering balance and hierarchy

**Composition Rules**:

**Balance**:
- Visual weight distributed across canvas
- Avoid all elements clustered in one area
- Use symmetry or intentional asymmetry

**Hierarchy**:
- Center 70% is primary (asset placement)
- Edges/corners are secondary (supporting elements)
- Top 250px and bottom 180px are tertiary (safe zones)

**Flow**:
- Create visual pathways through composition
- Use diagonal lines for dynamic energy
- Use horizontal/vertical lines for stability

**Breathing Room**:
- Don't overcrowd the canvas
- Leave areas of rest (solid color or simple gradient)
- 40-60% of canvas should be "quiet" space

## Aesthetic Spectrum

IconScout backgrounds exist on a spectrum between:

### Professional ←→ Playful

**More Professional** (For business, enterprise, serious content):
- Cooler color palettes (blues, purples, grays)
- Cleaner geometric patterns
- Subdued saturation (30-50%)
- Minimal shapes (2-3 elements)
- Smooth, polished gradients

**More Playful** (For creative, fun, energetic content):
- Warmer color palettes (oranges, pinks, yellows)
- Organic, flowing shapes
- Higher saturation (60-80%)
- More elements (4-5 shapes)
- Dynamic, energetic compositions

**Balanced** (Default - works for most content):
- Mixed warm/cool palette
- Combination of geometric and organic
- Medium saturation (50-60%)
- 3-4 elements
- Diagonal gradients with corner accents

## Technical Requirements

### Resolution
- **Always**: 1080x1920 pixels (9:16 aspect ratio)
- **Never**: Any other resolution

### Safe Zones

**Top Safe Zone** (250px from top):
- Avoid critical visual elements
- OK: Gradient continuation, background elements
- Avoid: Important shapes, high-contrast patterns

**Bottom Safe Zone** (180px from bottom):
- Avoid critical visual elements
- OK: Gradient continuation, background elements
- Avoid: Important shapes, high-contrast patterns

**Center Asset Zone** (756x1344px, centered):
- Keep relatively clean for asset overlay
- OK: Smooth gradients, subtle patterns
- Avoid: Busy patterns, high-contrast elements

### File Format
- **Preferred**: PNG (for transparency support if needed)
- **Alternative**: JPG (for smaller file sizes)
- **Output**: Whatever the AI generation API provides

## What Not to Do

### ❌ Common Mistakes

1. **Drawing the Asset**
   - NEVER include logos, icons, or illustrations in background
   - Background should be ONLY abstract shapes and colors
   - Asset will be added later as separate overlay

2. **Overcrowding**
   - Too many shapes competing for attention
   - Busy patterns that distract from asset
   - Solution: Simplify, remove elements

3. **Color Clashes**
   - Using exact same colors as asset
   - Colors that fight rather than complement
   - Solution: Use color theory, test with asset

4. **Ignoring Safe Zones**
   - Important elements in top 250px or bottom 180px
   - Busy patterns in center 70%
   - Solution: Review Instagram Story specs

5. **Generic Stock Photo Look**
   - Literal photography backgrounds
   - Cliché stock imagery
   - Solution: Abstract, gradient-based designs

6. **Wrong Brand Tone**
   - Too corporate/stuffy
   - Too childish/unprofessional
   - Solution: Balance professional + playful

7. **Poor Center Contrast**
   - Center too dark or too light for asset
   - Insufficient contrast for visibility
   - Solution: Medium tones (40-60% brightness)

## Quality Checklist

Before approving a background, verify:

- [ ] Resolution is exactly 1080x1920px
- [ ] No text, logos, icons, or assets drawn in background
- [ ] Colors align with IconScout palette (or justify deviation)
- [ ] Style feels modern, professional, yet vibrant
- [ ] Top 250px and bottom 180px clear of critical elements
- [ ] Center 70% suitable for asset overlay
- [ ] Composition is intentional, not random
- [ ] Visual complexity is balanced (not too simple, not too busy)
- [ ] Colors will complement asset (based on asset analysis)
- [ ] Energy level matches content type

## Refinement Guidelines

If background doesn't meet standards:

### Issue: Too Complex
- **Action**: Simplify by 40-50%, keep only essential elements
- **Prompt**: "Reduce element count, use broader gradients"

### Issue: Too Simple
- **Action**: Add 1-2 thoughtful elements, increase gradient complexity
- **Prompt**: "Add subtle geometric accents in corners"

### Issue: Wrong Colors
- **Action**: Refer to color theory, use complementary palette
- **Prompt**: "Adjust colors to complement [ASSET_COLORS]"

### Issue: Poor Center Area
- **Action**: Lighten/darken center, simplify patterns
- **Prompt**: "Optimize center 70% for [LIGHT/DARK] asset overlay"

### Issue: Not IconScout Brand
- **Action**: Increase vibrancy, modernize composition, add intentional restraint
- **Prompt**: "Align with IconScout aesthetic: modern, vibrant, professional"
